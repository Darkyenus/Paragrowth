- Sun/lighting source
- Separate world and water render
	- Water should be slightly transparent at edges
	- Noise textures for water waves
	- Specular shading for water
- World shading for better depth perception
- Skybox!
- Multiple way world blending and generation, probably on off thread?
	- Blend-map should probably be polygonional, not raster
